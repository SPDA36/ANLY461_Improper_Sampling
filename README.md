# PURPOSE
* The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate improper sampling.  $x_1$ and $x_2$ are sampled properly and represent their intended population.  $x_3$ was not sampled properly as it was a mix of $x_1$ and $x_2$.  $x_3$ did not capture the intended population.  An ANOVA test was conducted and concluded that $x_1$ and $x_2$ were significantly different, but when they were compared to $x_3$ they were not significantly different.  By design this was intended to illustrate that becase we sampled $x_3$ incorrectly, we have an incorrect conclusion about the differences in groups.
